# hello-world
My first GitHub Repository Creation process.
This is my way of comprehending, how to create GitHub Repository along with creation of Master branch & other branches. Where we push the changes to branches(which is the photocopy of exact MasterBranch at the time). If any new changes were merged to Master branch from other branches from other people. We must pull those changes to our branch also. Later on we will have discussions with other team members regarding the new feature additions/changes I created or bug fixed to finally merge to Master branch.
